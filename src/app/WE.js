        title:'It is argued that getting married before finishing school or getting a job is foolish. To what extent do you agree or disagree? ',
        titleDescription:'有人认为，在完成学业或找到工作之前结婚是愚蠢的。 你在多大程度上同意或不同意? ',
        one: 'There is an ongoing debate on the timing of getting married. Some people claim that getting married before being financially independent is not a good idea, whereas some disagree. Personally speaking, I strongly agree that getting married before finishing school or getting a job is foolish. ',
        oneDespection:'关于结婚的时间问题，目前仍有争论。有些人声称在经济独立之前结婚不是一个好主意，而有些人则不同意。就我个人而言，我强烈同意在完成学业或找工作之前结婚是愚蠢的。',
        two: 'The first and the most important reason for my belief is that getting married before completing school or getting a job can cause a financial burden because couples do not have enough income to support their life. To be more specific, various aspects of life incur costs for married couples when supporting a family, such as buying a house or purchasing a vehicle. This can be established by a recent study by Oxford University, which stated that 71.3% of the couples who got married before finishing school or getting a job ended up with divorce as they do not have enough income to support their living costs.',
        twoDespection:'我相信的第一个也是最重要的原因是，在完成学业或找到工作之前结婚可能会造成经济负担，因为夫妻没有足够的收入来维持他们的生活。更具体地说，已婚夫妇在养家时，生活的各个方面都会产生成本，比如买房或买车。牛津大学最近的一项研究证实了这一点，该研究表明，71.3%在完成学业或找到工作之前结婚的夫妇最终离婚，因为他们没有足够的收入来支付生活费用。',
        three:'On the other hand, the second reason for this argument is that getting married before finishing school or getting a job can limit people_s social networks, which is harmful to their future career development. To illustrate, those who are married must spend more time on family affairs than socializing with people from schools or the professional field, which deprives them of opportunities to obtain new information that is conducive to the development of their study or career. According to the annual report of the Australian government, more than 70% of the citizens stated that getting married before finishing their education or getting a job could influence their social networks negatively.',
        threeDespection:'另一方面，这种说法的第二个原因是，在完成学业或找到工作之前结婚会限制人们的社交网络，这对他们未来的职业发展有害。举例来说，那些已婚的人必须花更多的时间在家庭事务上，而不是与学校或专业领域的人社交，这剥夺了他们获得有利于他们学习或职业发展的新信息的机会。根据澳大利亚政府的年度报告，超过70%的公民表示，在完成教育或找到工作之前结婚可能会对他们的社交网络产生负面影响。',
        four:'With all the points above, the conclusion can be made that getting married before completing study or getting a job is irrational due to the creation of financial burden and limitation of people_s social networks.',
        fourDespection:'综上所述，可以得出这样的结论：由于经济负担的产生和人们社交网络的限制，在完成学业或找到工作之前结婚是不合理的。'

        title:'Some people think human behaviors can be changed by laws, while others think laws have little effect. What is your opinion.',
        titleDescription:'一些人认为法律可以改变人的行为，另一些人认为法律没有什么作用。你的意见是什么? ',
        one: 'Laws are important to current society because they distinguish between right and wrong. Some people think human behaviors can be changed by laws, whereas others think laws have little effect. Personally speaking, I strongly believe that laws can change human behaviors. ',
        oneDespection:'法律对当今社会很重要，因为它们区分是非。有些人认为法律可以改变人类的行为，而另一些人则认为法律几乎没有作用。就我个人而言，我坚信法律可以改变人类的行为。',
        two: 'The first and the most important reason for my belief is that laws can change human behaviors because people are constrained by the punishment brought by laws. To be specific, people are aware that there will be consequences and punishment that comes from law enforcement for any illegal activities, so people tend to control their desire from criminal behaviors. This can be established by a recent study by Oxford University, which stated that the crime rate has dropped by 89% under the influence of law.',
        twoDespection:'我相信的第一个也是最重要的原因是，法律可以改变人类的行为，因为人们受到法律带来的惩罚的约束。具体来说，人们意识到任何非法活动都会受到执法的后果和惩罚，因此人们倾向于从犯罪行为中控制自己的欲望。牛津大学最近的一项研究证实了这一点，该研究表明，在法律的影响下，犯罪率下降了89%。',
        three:'On the other hand, the second reason for this argument is that laws provide general guidance for people. To illustrate, laws give people correct instructions when people are facing an ethical dilemma or moral hazard. Besides, laws teach individuals how to deal with complex issues and introduce a border between right and wrong, which can prevent people from doing unethical things. According to the annual report of the Australian government, more than 70% of the citizens stated that laws ensure people do the right things.',
        threeDespection:'另一方面，这一论点的第二个原因是法律为人们提供了一般性的指导。举例来说，当人们面临道德困境或道德风险时，法律会给人们正确的指示。此外，法律教会个人如何处理复杂的问题，并引入是非界限，这可以防止人们做不道德的事情。根据澳大利亚政府的年度报告，超过70%的公民表示，法律确保人们做正确的事情。',
        four:'With all the points above, the conclusion can be made that laws can change human behaviors because it is a restrictive approach to prevent crimes and provides general guidance for individuals.',
        fourDespection:'综上所述，可以得出这样的结论：法律可以改变人类行为，因为它是预防犯罪的一种限制性方法，并为个人提供了一般性指导。'

        one: 'In some companies, employers let employees be involved in the decision-making process of products and services. Personally speaking, this management method has both advantages and disadvantages.',
        oneDespection:'在一些公司，雇主让员工参与产品和服务的决策过程。就我个人而言，这种管理方法既有优点也有缺点。',
        two: 'The key benefit of letting employees attend a decision-making meeting is that it can increase employees’ working performance. To be more specific, when employees are involved in companies’ decision-making processes, they will feel respected and improve their enthusiasm for work. For example, a recent report from the Microsoft Company can further support my idea, which mentions when employees get involved in decision-making meetings for a new wifi adaptor, their working performance increased at least 89%.',
        twoDespection:'让员工参加决策会议的主要好处是可以提高员工的工作绩效。更具体地说，当员工参与公司的决策过程时，他们会感到受到尊重，并提高他们的工作热情。例如，微软公司最近的一份报告可以进一步支持我的想法，该报告提到，当员工参加新wifi适配器的决策会议时，他们的工作表现至少提高了89%。',
        three:'The main downside of involving some employees in the decision-making process about their products and services is that such a method would decrease the working efficiency of companies. To be more specific, employees involved in the decision-making process need to follow several complex procedures under the regulatory framework of companies, and it consumes too much time, which will reduce the efficiency of companies. To further support my statement, an article published in China Daily revealed that 50% of employers believed that employees participating in the decision-making process might decrease the working efficiency of companies.',
        threeDespection:'让一些员工参与其产品和服务的决策过程的主要缺点是，这种方法会降低公司的工作效率。更具体地说，在公司的监管框架下，参与决策过程的员工需要遵循几个复杂的程序，而且这消耗了太多的时间，这将降低公司的效率。为了进一步支持我的说法，《中国日报》上发表的一篇文章透露，50%的雇主认为员工参与决策过程可能会降低公司的工作效率。',
        four:'With all the points above, engaging employees in the decision-making process brings both benefits and problems. Therefore, companies should weigh the advantages against the disadvantages before determining the strategy.',
        fourDespection:'有了以上所有要点，让员工参与决策过程既带来好处，也带来问题。因此，在确定战略之前，公司应该权衡利弊。'

        titleDescription:'正式的笔试是评估学生学习成绩的有效方法。你在多大程度上同意或不同意?',
        one: 'There is no doubt that the formal written examination has been a conventional way to evaluate students’ performance. Some people argue that this is the best way for assessment in schools, whereas others believe that more innovative methods should replace written exams. Personally speaking, the formal written examination is a valid method to assess students’ learning process, which can be supported as follows.',
        oneDespection:'毫无疑问，正式的笔试已经成为评估学生成绩的一种常规方式。一些人认为这是学校评估的最佳方式，而另一些人则认为更具创新性的方法应该取代笔试。就我个人而言，正式笔试是评估学生学习过程的有效方法，可以支持如下。',
        two: 'The first and the most important reason for my belief is that the formal written examination can be a valid method to assess students’ learning because it can estimate whether they have a solid foundation of the subjects they learned in this term or not. To be specific, the formal written exam is an integrated test, which can test how deep the students master the knowledge, and it can reflect the student learning results through academic marks. To take my own experience as an example, I gained a low score in one subject, which means I did not grasp the knowledge well.',
        twoDespection:'我相信的第一个也是最重要的原因是，正式的笔试可以成为评估学生学习情况的有效方法，因为它可以评估他们是否对本学期所学的科目有坚实的基础。具体来说，正式笔试是一种综合测试，它可以测试学生对知识的掌握程度，它可以通过学业成绩来反映学生的学习成绩。以我自己的经历为例，我在一门课上得了低分，这意味着我没有很好地掌握知识。',
        three:'On the other hand, the second reason for this argument is that the formal exam can assess how much time students spend on reviewing their courses. To illustrate, if students spend enough time on each subject and have a deep understanding of it, they will get good scores on the formal exam. This can be established by a recent study by Oxford University, which stated that over 76% of the students who spend sufficient time studying can gain good academic performance from the exams, which means the formal written exam is a valid method.',
        threeDespection:'另一方面，这种说法的第二个原因是，正式考试可以评估学生花在复习课程上的时间。举例来说，如果学生在每门科目上花足够的时间并深入了解，他们就会在正式考试中取得好成绩。牛津大学最近的一项研究证实了这一点，该研究表明，花足够时间学习的学生中，超过76%的人可以从考试中获得良好的学习成绩，这意味着正式笔试是一种有效的方法。',
        four:'With all the points above, the conclusion can be drawn that formal written examination is a valid method because it can directly evaluate students’ performance. In this regard, schools should promote the use of such exams.',
        fourDespection:'综合以上几点，可以得出这样的结论：正式笔试是一种有效的方法，因为它可以直接评估学生的成绩。在这方面，学校应该提倡使用这种考试。'
