Psychologists have a technique for looking at intelligence that ____ not require the cooperation of the animal involved. The relative size of an individual's brain is a reasonable indication of intelligence. Comparing _____ species is not as simple as generally expected. An elephant will have a larger brain than a human has simply because it is a large beast. _______, we use the Cephalization index, which compares the size of an animal's brain with the size of its body. Based on the Cephalization index, the brightest animals on the planet are humans, ________ by great apes, porpoises and elephants. As a general _____, animals that hunt for a living (like canines) are smarter than strict vegetarians (you don't need much intelligence to outsmart a leaf of lettuce). Animals that live in social groups are always smarter and have larger EQ's than solitary animals.",

Why we are living longer is not the issue for anyone _______ in drawing up plans to market a product.

For example, ___________ referring simply to 'adults', there are now 'starting adults', 'young adults' and 'established adults'. ________, markets no longer talk about 'children', but tend to refer to a fuller range of categories that includes 'kids', 'tweens', 'pre-teens' and 'teenagers'.
